# Multi-Page Website Project

## Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to create a multi-page website using HTML and CSS that focuses on a specific area of interest. Students will be required to incorporate various media elements, such as images, videos, and audio, using appropriate HTML tags.

## Instructions:

### Choose Your Area of Interest:
Select a specific area of interest for your website. It could be anything from agriculture, medicine, tourism, technology, sports, or any other field you are passionate about.

### Create a Five-Page Website:
Develop a website consisting of five pages. Each page should represent a different aspect or sub-topic related to your chosen area of interest. Examples include: Home, About Us, Services, Gallery, Contact.

### HTML Structure:
Ensure that each page has a clear HTML structure with proper use of tags, including `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.

### CSS Styling:
Apply CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal of your website. Use external CSS files to keep your code organized. Consider font styles, colors, margins, padding, and other design elements.

### Images:
Include relevant images on each page. Utilize the `<img>` tag to display images. Ensure that the images are appropriately sized and enhance the overall aesthetic of your website.

### Videos:
Embed at least one video related to your area of interest. You can use the `<video>` tag to embed a local video file or `<iframe>` for embedding a video from platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.

### Audio:
Integrate at least one audio element. This could be a background music track, an interview related to your topic, or any other relevant audio content. Use the `<audio>` tag for this purpose.

### Navigation:
Implement a navigation menu that allows users to easily move between the different pages. Use the `<nav>` tag and consider styling it with CSS to make it visually appealing.

### Responsive Design:
Ensure that your website is responsive. Use media queries in your CSS to adapt the layout for different screen sizes, such as mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
